# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

*   Initial creation and population of the Memory Bank for the `google-forms-mcp` project.
*   Analyzing the existing project structure and code to accurately document its current state.

## Recent Changes & Decisions

*   **Decision:** To create and populate all six core Memory Bank files as defined in `.clinerules`.
*   **Change:** Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` and populated it with an overview of the project.
*   **Change:** Created `memory-bank/productContext.md` and populated it with details about the project's purpose and user experience.
*   **Change:** Created `memory-bank/techContext.md` and populated it with information about technologies, setup, and dependencies.
*   **Change:** Created `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` and populated it with architectural details and data flows.
*   The content for these files was derived from analyzing `package.json`, `README.md`, `src/index.ts`, and `src/get-refresh-token.ts`.

## Next Steps

*   Populate `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file) with the current status of memory bank creation.
*   Populate `memory-bank/progress.md` with an assessment of the project's current completeness and known elements.
*   Confirm with the user that the initial Memory Bank population is complete.

## Open Questions & Considerations

*   Are there any other existing documents or implicit knowledge about the project that should be incorporated into the Memory Bank at this stage?
*   Once the initial population is done, what will be the next active task for this project?

## Session Goal (If applicable)

*   To complete the initial population of all core Memory Bank files.
